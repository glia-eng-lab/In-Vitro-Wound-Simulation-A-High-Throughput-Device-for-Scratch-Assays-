Steps:
1. Run Basic Scratch Measurements.ijm
2. Run Skeleton Measurements.ijm
3. Run Path_Analysis.m
4. Run Width_and_Roughness_Analysis.m
5. Run Summarize_Measurements.m

Brief Description:
Basic Scratch Measurements.ijm -  binarizes image, takes preliminary measurements (length), and saves cropped images for later scripts
Skeleton Measurements.ijm - skeletonizes scratches and takes skeleton measurements (midline length)
Run Path_Analysis.m - analyzes data output from Skeleton Measurements macro
Width_and_Roughness_Analysis.m - measures width and roughness of scratches
Summarize_Measurements.m - combines measurement outputs from previous macros

A more detailed description of each macro and a walkthrough is provided in Video C.1.
